- NOTE: Make sure you are on your personal profile before doing this step. Unfortunately, due to how strict My school is with their profiel management, which is a very good thing by the way, personal profiel usage is needed. Head over to Google Chrome, and type in "'chrome://extensions'" in your search bar, and press Enter.

- Find where you extracted the main folder with all the files in. Take that folder and drag and drop it into chrome. This will install the extension to your chrome application.

All you have to do to use the Chrome extension is click the little Red Warning symbol!
What Happens:
- ALL chrome tabs and windows close
- A new window opens with the specified URLs that you gave the extension in the options page.

## Changing URLs

Chnaging the opening URLs are pretty simple.

By default, if a user hasn't set a URL, the default URL will be set to "managebac.com" (random website)
If a user wishes to change the URLs that open when they click the Warning Symbol, they must do so in the Extension Options page. This is done by going to chrome://extensions > Press the "Details" button on the Tab Switcher Extension > Scroll down and click "Extension Options"
